🌐 Excited to unveil my latest project: a chatbot powered by AWS Bedrock's and Large Language model "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0" by Anthropic. With Bedrock and the Anthropic model at its core, my chatbot has elevated my learning experience and honed my skills on this exciting journey.

🧠 Leveraging LangChain technology, my chatbot boasts the capability to maintain context and remember previous conversations, ensuring a seamless and immersive user experience. With a memory limit of up to 1024 tokens. (Note: Token limit adjusted for learning purposes and cost considerations.)

🖥️ Streamlit serves as the sleek and intuitive front-end interface, making interactions with the chatbot effortless. Users can engage in natural conversations, receive personalized responses, and explore the possibilities of AI-driven communication.

💡 Key Features:

Anthropic Model: Access to AWS Bedrock's pre-trained model and cloud service make it easy to develop without expensive GPU power.
LangChain Memory: The chatbot's contextual memory enhances conversation flow and user engagement, providing a truly immersive experience.
Streamlit Interface: The user-friendly interface offers seamless navigation and interaction, catering to users of all backgrounds.

🌟 Join me on this exciting journey of AI innovation where we develop and learn something new every day.

I'm excited to share my latest project: a chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities!

🌐 Chatbot with RAG: By leveraging the power of AWS Bedrock and LangChain, I've developed a chatbot that seamlessly integrates retrieval-augmented generation for enhanced interactions. For this chatbot, I have used the anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0 model by Anthropic.

🧠 Key Technologies Utilized:

Streamlit: A sleek and intuitive front-end interface that makes interacting with the chatbot effortless.
ConversationBufferWindowMemory from LangChain: Ensures the chatbot maintains context and remembers previous conversations, providing a seamless and immersive user experience.

ConversationalRetrievalChain from LangChain.chains: Enhances the chatbot's ability to retrieve and generate contextually relevant information on-the-fly.

PDF as Local RAG Source: Uses PDF documents as a source for retrieval-augmented generation, ensuring the chatbot has access to external information other than the information it was trained on. (A single document is used for demo purposes; other sources of information may be used depending on the scenario and use cases.)

BedrockEmbeddings: Utilizes AWS Bedrock's powerful embeddings for accurate language understanding and processing.

FAISS: Uses FAISS as an in-memory vector store for demo purposes (It uses RAM on the local system to store data for demo purposes. When creating an end-to-end project, ChromaDB or PineCone Vector Database will be used).

RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Enables effective handling of large text documents by breaking them down into manageable chunks. Due to the token limits of the model and window size, a single large document cannot be passed directly into the model.
